## Daily log of my progress - started on November 19, 2020

### Day 1 - 11-19-2020
- I already started Coding again some 3 weeks ago, but I just found the 100 days of Code Challenge and wanted 
to start this now
- finished my survey project in FCC: https://codepen.io/jobo0o/pen/PozvGOr
    - I struggled with aligning the boxes in the center but after a bit of trial and error I figured it out
- contuniued with the JS challenges in FCC (75% done)

### Day 2 - 11-20-2020
- continued with the FCC challenges for Basic JavaScript
- there were a lot of more difficult challenges that definetly got my head burning
- for loops, especially the nested for loops were the more difficult challenge today

### Day 3 - 11-21-2020

- clsoe to finishing the Basic JavaScript part
- focused on looping information and trying to understand recursive functions

### Day 4 - 11-22-2020
- finished the Basic JavaScript part in FreeCodeCamp 
    - especially understanding the recursive functions was a challenge
    - I still did not fully understand how those functions are working
- started with a product landing page for the HTML/CSS certification in FreeCodeCamp
    - setup of the html Code & first stylings in CSS
    - I learned how to insert icons from Font Awesome and hwo to resize them
    - still I feel like CSS is a bit more complicated, since it it not "automatically" following the clear top-down structure like html
    - fitting the boxes accordingly is still difficult
- I will continue with the stylings tomorrow

- started editing CSS styling for the crossblocks website
    - understanding @media query

- searched for useful Coding books to read on the side

### Day 7 - 11-25-2020
- spake about my progress with an expereinced web developer
- explored some different CSS frameworks, since I am struggeling with structure in my CSS code
    - BEM and other methods could help me to write my CSS Code in the future

### Day 10 - 11-28-2020
- finished the regular expressions challenges in FreeCodeCamp
    - I think the last 50% of the challenges will not really help me writing my code..
- CSS styling on the product landing page
- found an interesting guide about the CSS flexbox

### Day 11 - 11-29-2020
- finished the product landing page challenge on FCC
- really not proud of my work here but I had to move on
- I still learned a lot about when and how to use classes & IDs, aswell as how the felxbox is working
- even though it looks super bad and shitty, it is still a very good learning, progress is better than no progress at all
